LED-Cube TODOs & Notes:
    hardware:
        PSU board:
            ☐ define Interface/Controller
            ☐ program Controller
        teensy controller:
            ☐ IO überprüfen
            ☐ design interface pcb

    software:
        main-controller-board:
            ☐ define interface to the cube-updater and the upater-board
            ☐ check IO pin controlling
            ☐ write IO pin manager
            ☐ define animation frame and timing
            ☐ check for pwm capabilities
            ☐ sill stick with the ATMEGA32? or switch controller completely to a teensy 4.1?

        cube-updater:
        Program on the controller of the Cube to play certain animations or receive
        live streamed images to show on the Cube.
            ☐ c# app? with the new netcore5-stack it could run on raspberry on linux...
            ☐ define animation network package
            ☐ define animation save package
            ☐ check writing to shift registers
            ☐ writing tests for cube controlling

        cube-animator:
        Program to create new animations frame by frame or with advanced selection and
        animation features.
            ☐ c# app? with the new netcore5-stack
            ☐ selection-stack
            ☐ 2d selection
            ☐ 3d selection
            ☐ timeline (frame selection)
            ☐ reconfigurable for different cube sizes

        cube-player:
        Program for Testing and Playing animation with streaming functionality.
        Can also use modules like audio-equalizer to send live data to the Cube.
            ☐ 3d view
            ☐ replay created animations
            pluginability:
                ☐ add module loading
                ☐ procedural animations
                ☐ audio-equalizer module
                ☐ 3d model viewer
                ☐ 3d snake
                ☐ 3d tetris

# LED-Cube MainController Project

This Repository contains the code for the main controller board of my LED cube. The microcontroller is a ATmega32-16 which is programmed in AVR-Studio. This Repo contains two different Project solutions:

### MainControllerAVR (AVR-Studio 7 Project)
This Project contains the code for the AVR-Compiller in order to create the .hex file for the micro.

### MainControllerTest (Visual Studio 2015 Project)

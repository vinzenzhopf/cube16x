Cube 16x TODO's:
    cube-controller:
        ☐ FrameTime correction. Allow animations to specify a dedicated frametime.
            Wait until the frame-time exceeded an start the next frame after this.
        
        ☐ Test Capabillity for Animatons
            Test to verify that Animations are running correctly
        ☐ Enable Native test debugging and breakpoints

        FrameBuffer:
            ☐ Add more plane functions
            ☐ Allow different perspectives when writing leds, rows or planes.
            ☐ Allow rotation by degrees. 
                Rotate the complete buffer? via Rotation Matrix?
                https://github.com/g-truc/glm/tree/master/doc
            ☐ Add Translation Methods?
            ☐ Add Scaling Methods?
            
        PlaylistManager:
            ☐ Sort out weired bug?
            ☐ Start by first animation, not second.

        Network Connectivity:
            ☐ Add Hardware for Network connectivity (Wiznet Module)
                Is Extra hardware needed? (Level shifter?)
                New Version of WizNetModule needed? Current is WIZ820io R1.0
            ☐ Integrate into current cube-controller
            ☐ Add NetworkStreamAnimation
            ☐ Pioritize NetworkStreamAnimation over other Animations in the PlaylistManager/AnimationController and interrupt other animations.

        Pixel Pipeline:
            ☐ Read into Pixel Pipeline Lib
                How to acces the "Pixel Processing Pipeline"
                https://forum.pjrc.com/threads/64860-T4-Pixel-Pipeline-Library
        
    Network Connectivity:
        ☐ Define Network Protocol
                Structure with leds, frame counter, frametime, ...
                tcp or udp?
            ☐ C# simple streaming app?
            
    Animations:
        Simple:
            ☐ RainDropsAnimation
                Set top plane to on; move random led down by one plane
            ☐ RandomOnOfAnimation
                Toggle random leds.
            ☐ BouncingCubeAnimation
                One cube, that stretches in each corner/edge of the cube.
            ☐ WaveAnimation
                Specifiable Wave-Form that travens from one side of the cube to an nother. Leds under the function are lit, above are off.

        Advanced:
            ☐ WhiskAnimation
                Cross of two intersecting planes, that rotate around one axis.
            ☐ WriteTextAnimation
                Add Font(s) and draw them on the cube.
                Static or translating
                Adjustable letter depth
            ☐ Bouncing Cubes
                Multiple cubes, that bouncing against each other
            ☐ NetworkStreamAnimation
                Receives an stream of Frames and writes them to the output.
            ☐ AudioSpecrumAnimation
                FFT over an Audio-Signal, that gets feeded into the Cube.
                Cube shows the Spectrum in 16 bands with the time on the third axis.
            ☐ Snake
                Play Snake over a dedicated Input device??
            ☐ Pong3D
                Play Pong in 3 dimensions
